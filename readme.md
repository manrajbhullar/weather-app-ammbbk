# Weather App

In this pair programming activity, you will work with your partner to design and implement a weather web app. The app will allow users to input a city name and receive real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. Focus on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Duration âŒ›

~30-40 minutes

## Suggested Steps

- Planning and Design
  - The structure of the user interface (input field, submit button, weather display).
  - How to handle API calls to fetch weather data.
  - Error handling (e.g., invalid city names, network errors).
  - UI layout and design (should be clean and intuitive).
- API Integration
  - Register for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
  - Write the logic to fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - Decide how you will parse and display the data (temperature, weather condition, etc.)
- UI Development
  - Build the front-end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Implement an input field where the user can type a city name.
  - Create a button to trigger the weather data fetch.
  - Display the fetched weather data in a user-friendly manner (e.g., city name, temperature, condition, icon).
- [Optional] Error Handling
  - Implement error handling for invalid city names, API errors, and empty input fields.
  - Test edge cases like non-existent cities or no internet connection.
- [Optional] Styling and UX :
  - Use CSS to create a clean, modern interface. Consider using a framework like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS to speed up the process. Ensure the UI is responsive.

# Deployment

- Deploy your weather app using a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

# Deliverables

- Add a link to your deployed weather app here in the README.
